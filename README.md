# 🌐 My Web Application in React  
> ⚠️ **Note:** This README.md is still under development!  
I am currently developing a webpage that introduces me from different perspectives.  
Here I document my process — what I’m working on, what I struggle with, and what I plan to implement next.

## 🎯 What the Webapp Will Cover (briefly speaking)
The web application will act as a personal, interactive portfolio and include:  
- 🎓 **Education**
- 💼 **Professional Experience**
- 🧠 **Hobby Projects**
- 🎨 **Personal Interests**
- 🔐 **Visualized Security Implementations**

Each page will provide interactive examples, clean design, and security-by-design principles applied in practice.

## 🐞 Struggles

### 🔸 Button expanding beyond the navigation bar  
When first working on the layout of my homepage, I was still learning how React handles components and TypeScript naming conventions.  

I wanted to replace the default HTML tag `<a>` with a more descriptive name (to make my codebase easier to extend later). However, this caused some unexpected styling behavior — particularly with buttons expanding beyond the navigation bar during hover animations.

#### 💻 Original Code Snippet
```tsx
// Example of initial implementation
<a href="/about">About</a>

```

## 🚩 Future Goals
Keep the main button in the navigation bar expanded, even when hovering over the dropdown window.

To achieve this I need to move my css styling from "my-button" to "dropdown".
#### 💻 Original Code Snippet
```css

```
