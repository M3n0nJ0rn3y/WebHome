# My Web-Application in React 
# NB: This README.md is still under development.
I am currently developing a webpage that introduces me from different perspectives. Here I will document my process, what I struggle with, and what I am currently planning to implement on my website. 

### Content of this page:
1. [Webapp content](#what-the-webapp-will-cover-briefly-speaking)
2. [Stuggles](#what-i-struggled-with)

### What the webapp will cover (briefly speaking):
* Education
* Proffesional experience
* Hobby Projects
* My diverse interests
* A visualization of various security implementations
